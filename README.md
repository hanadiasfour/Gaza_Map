# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm for Route Planning in Gaza

This project implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for maps, allowing users to find the most cost-effective route between cities in the Gaza Strip. The mapping of cities and road intersections is based on longitude and latitude lines obtained from Google Maps. In addition, distances were calculated dynamically using the Haversine formula, ensuring accuracy. The path, distance, source city, destination city, and route were all presented to the user through the map and some text fields.

## Features
- **Interactive City Selection:** One can choose the starting and destination cities easily, either by clicking on the map or selecting from a dropdown menu.
- **Flexible City Data:** City points were stored in a text file within the project, making it easy for anyone to modify and add new cities as needed.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Including Heap and Single Linked List.
- **GUI using JavaFX**

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the program.

I hope you enjoy using this route planning tool as much as I enjoyed creating it.
