# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm for Route Planning in Gaza

This project implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for the Gaza strip map. The mapping of cities and road intersections is based on longitude and latitude lines obtained from Google Maps. The distances were calculated dynamically using the Haversine formula. The path, distance, source city, destination city, and route were all presented to the user through a GUI.

## More Details
- Choose the starting and destination cities easily, either by clicking on the map or selecting from a dropdown menu.
- The city points were inputed from a text file within the project.
- GUI implemented using JavaFX

I hope you enjoy using this route planning tool as much as I enjoyed creating it.
