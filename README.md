# **Project Description:**
Implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm optimized for maps, facilitating route planning between cities with the lowest cost. The program utilizes a custom-designed heap data structure to enhance efficiency and accuracy. City points are stored in a text file within the project, allowing for easy modification and addition of new cities. The mapping of cities and road intersections is based on longitude and latitude lines obtained from Google Maps, ensuring accuracy. The program calculates distances dynamically using the Haversine formula, offering realistic and precise route planning.

## **Additional Details:**
- Custom Heap Data Structure: Developed to optimize Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient shortest path computation.
- City Points: Contained in a text file within the project, facilitating easy modification and expansion.
- Mapping Accuracy: Longitude and latitude lines obtained from Google Maps ensure accuracy, with additional points added to streets for realistic curvature.
- Dynamic Distance Calculation: Utilizes the Haversine formula to calculate distances dynamically during runtime, enhancing precision in route planning.

This project showcases the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for practical route planning applications, with a focus on accuracy and efficiency, supplemented by custom data structures and dynamic distance calculation methods.
